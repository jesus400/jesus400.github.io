        <h3>Labor exploitation</h3>
        <p> All employees are entitled to minimum wage within their first year of employment. After workers have completed their first year, wages are decided by both the employer and employee.
            There is no national minimum wage—applicable minimum wage varies based on the type of business and its location. There are 33 provinces in Indonesia and the governor of each province sets a monthly wage rate per recommendation from the Provincial Council on Wages. It is also possible for a regency (an area within a province) to set its own minimum wage, provided this wage is not higher than the one determined by the province. A 2018 regulation (the Minister of Manpower and Transmigration Regulation) officially established a formula for calculating this wage based on inflation and GDP growth in Indonesia.
            There are also minimum wages determined by sector. These wage rates are set by business groups within a province or regency and cannot be lower than the wage set by the province or regency.
            In addition to deductions for income tax, employers are required to make two kinds of social security deductions: they must contribute to the badan penyelenggara jaminan sosial (the health security system or BPJS) and to the employment BJPS, which covers work accidents and old age pension.</p>

        <p> Some Laws are available in the internet, however, a lot of laws are not available for free. In such cases. we have to ask the competent government authority. The legalized date, effective date and  promulgated date are stipulated in the regulation and it is published in state gazette. Basically the effective date is same to the promulgated date. However, it sometimes happens in Indonesia that we cannot find the regulations in state gazette and/or the website of the competent authority even after the promulgated date. When I worked for the Embassy of Japan in Indonesia and paid attention to the revision of the regulation, I had experiences to become to know the regulation a few weeks or months after the date of promulgation. Even though the new laws are legally promulgated and effective, the laws are not known in public (governmental officials also do not know the laws.), and it is not applied practically.  It is so strange for us, however,  such situation sometimes happens in Indonesia. We have to understand it. </p>
