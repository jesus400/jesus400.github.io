                <h3>Law 379</h3>
                <p> <b>Article 1.</b>  
                    Explanation of Reasons <br>
                    This Law consecrates the principle of the limitation of the working day: one of the great
                    worker demands. It is an effective health protection measure, the
                    worker safety and life. Excessive working hours cause fatigue,
                    they increase the frequency of work accidents and break the vigor of the organism,
                    exposing you to sickness and disease. In addition, they deprive the worker of time
                    necessary for the solace and cultivation of their spirit and their social and civic relationships.
                    On the other hand, there is a technical rationale to support the convenience of limiting
                    the day: the performance of the work is in inverse ratio of its prolongation. Experiences
                    of Laboratory affirm that, when the work is prolonged in an immoderate way, the
                    fatigue, and this determines in the organism a chemical process of true intoxication that, in addition to the physical and spiritual damage that it provides to the worker, substantially reduces the
                    work productivity.
                    The reduction in working hours also contributes to alleviating the unemployment problem, since,
                    By reducing the hours of work of the men and women who work, they provide
                    additional employment opportunities for the unemployed.
                    With the mechanization of work and the rationalization of industrial organization, production has
                    considerably increased, but also the effort of the worker, now compelled to
                    render their service with mechanism and under techniques that require extreme dexterity and attention
                    constant. Nothing is more natural than the worker reaching the benefit of mechanical cultivation and
                    rationalization in the form of a more human day of work.
                    It is the policy of this Law to limit to a maximum of eight hours the legal working day in
                    Puerto Rico and provide the payment of a double type of salary for hours worked in excess
                    of the legal day. Experience shows that a prohibitive provision is not enough to
                    achieve the desired limitation. The penalty imposed on the employer who violates the prohibitive precept
                    it does not take advantage of the employee or reward his effort when the day is prolonged. Of
                    effective and practical scope is the payment, by rule of law, of double compensation for
                    hours worked in excess of the legal working day. Such a measure, while discouraging the
                    employment in overtime due to the additional economic burden imposed on the employer,
                    entails a more just compensation for the man forced to render a day
                    elderly.
                    It is hereby declared that the policy of this Act is, through the exercise of the power
                    of the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico to enact laws for the protection of life,
                    the health and safety of employees and workers, correct and as quickly as possible
                    eliminate the conditions of exploitation of the worker based on excessive working hours,
                    substantially increase jobs and provide better employee compensation in
                    those cases in which the employer extends the working day.
